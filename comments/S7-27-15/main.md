# Original main frame

We respectfully submit this collaborative letter with the viewpoint that Satoshi Nakamoto [is dead](https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10). We believe that this perspective shapes the industry’s next options given the [sentiments](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/07/27/open-access-interoperability-and-the-dtccs-unexpected-path-to-monopoly/) of Dr. Dan Awrey, Esq. and Joshua Macey, Esq.[^industry] Ms. Countryman, given recent [public demand](https://wooten.link/gme) for a new transparent trading and settlement system,[^] we respectfully submit this decentralized framework to restore confidence in our most advanced, developed, and liquid capital market.[^american]

Cannot be Transfer Agent and Broker Dealer, problamatic speeration custody implications
“Netting is a function commonly performed by clearing agencies and may also be performed by broker-dealers for customers holding in street name, but is not among the core functions enumerated in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25) performed by registered transfer agents.”

All agree that (i) DTCC is systemically important and needs bailoit (ii) DTCC is on the brink of bailout per eg, GME but via references to Prev (iii) therefore there needs to be a system in place to replace DTCC so that we arent perpetually bailing out the CCPs, the only such system being blockchain. Make the case for using Stellar, a distributed ledger well-known to innovative...staff.

In response to comments by :
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that: “[T]he historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have generally withstood even severe crises. This solid performance reflects good planning and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by both the private and public sectors.” Good luck is not a strategy, so why can I be confident that Treasury clearinghouses [the FICC] will perform even in times of market stress?



On the SRO structure from PREV: extrapolate this to confer presidentail control over the DTC as a de-facto industry requirement to operate in the transfer agent business for public US compnaies
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/561/477/

Our rules can serve to increase barriers to entry and entrench large competitors, which leads to market concentration.
&mdash; Commissioner Hester M. Peirce 

Ms. Countryman, as you may recall, this statement was made in response the to rule approved in December last year legalizing the monopoliztion of the Treasury securities clearing and settlement market.[^setl] 

This development is particularly problamatic because XYZ

We agree with TRES’ poisiton that “”the traasurty market super important yay””. However, we find these recent develop[ments contrary to the public policy objectives trumpteted by recent FTC actions aimed at preventing undue monoplization.[^aapl] More to the point, we respectfully submit to the commission that “DIRECT MONPOLY QUOTE FROM RULE talking about lowering interbank credit risk,” while well-intentioned, fails to contemplate the alternative deployment of a debit-based diret investor-to-investor trading sstme using distributed ledger technology.

"We need to end self-regulation in financial services. 

Many law and finance academics have been arguing for an end to this "failed experiment" for a while.

In the US Code, the only industry that has codified self-regulation is financial services... [all other industry groups] are in a sense self-regulated... but it’s not codified. There’s not a law that says they have to [follow SRO rules].^See also notes 16, 21, and 137 in PREV

The problem is self-regulation... The SEC approved what they believed was a rule regarding mandatory buy-ins, which was in fact a rule to eliminate the word mandatory from buy-ins—to make them voluntary. {File No. SR-NYSE-2005-50}

I truly believe we have to get rid of the self-regulatory option in financial services.

{{potential ending quote}} In fact, Bill Denser used to say, “Depository Trust Company: trust is our middle name.” If people don’t trust the Depository, then the whole thing falls apart. Which is kind of where we are now, right? We’re at a point where we don’t trust the centralized system. We don’t trust the regulators.

We have corruption in our goverment as much as other couintries have corruption in 

We went through all these machinations 20 years ago, and yet here we are today and people are still asking, “What do you think about naked short selling?” Well, I think failures to deliver are the root of your problem. Why short, when you can fail to deliver?

We heard so much about naked short selling 20 years ago, and then here we are today still talking about naked short selling... even if you borrow the shares to deliver for settlement, then you still have created an IOU—you’ve created a phantom share—in the account of the person who loaned the shares out. {{extra phantom shares floating around}} 

[L]aw and finance academics have been arguing for an end to this "failed experiment" for a while.

The spread of blockchains is bad for anyone in the “trust business”—the centralised institutions and bureaucracies, such as banks, clearing houses and government authorities that are deemed sufficiently trustworthy to handle transactions. Even as some banks and governments explore the use of this new technology, others will surely fight it. But given the decline in trust in governments and banks in recent years, a way to create more scrutiny and transparency could be no bad thing.
— _The Economist_

> You’ve all seen _The Big Short_... What went wrong there? It was a lack of transparency in these major mortgage-backed securities frameworks. Well guess what the principle benefit of the blockchain is? A transparent, immutable ledger. We have the solution to that problem.
> You know the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. That crisis, guess what? Has not been fixed. So, it’s over, we got lucky. But in fact, we took—to fix the problem—what was too big to fail, and we turned it into too bigger to fail. The problem is not better. And, in fact, there’s a huge demand for liquidity; many folks expect that there may be a liquidity crisis in the next year or two. The old financial system cannot fix this.
> [Centralized trust] very nearly caused our financial system to come down. It is quite possible that, without a replacement... the next problem is worse. And what was a crisis becomes a collapse.

# Narrative ideas

- We don't trust Wall St because Wall St doesn't trust us.[^trust]
- Requisite decentralized clearing/settlemnet/exhange [exchange since obv no need for delegation in digital assets][^jed_1]
- Direct clearing for brokers to use with simle settlement regime comeptition(use as segue to anticompetative practices and materially dive into the need for competition from TAs)
- Narrative around TA future as  seomthign more than a cert pusher, express neeed fro better systems per EQ hack and horrendus best pract
- Using regulatory status to preclude competition[^ta-alt]
- FAST requirements are based on a flawed system for transferring ownershuip of book entry securities
- FAST requirements do not protect investors because TAs can get 100%-deductable insurance (coul use adequately here if youi want to give some derffference to commission rulemaking procedures commenting on the policies)

[^trust]: _See, e.g., supra_ note [] at n.X detailing the manipulation of capitalistic supply and demand when firsm ceased believing in the ability of free markets to accurately value multiple public companies with current Commission filings.
[^jed_1]: _See, e.g.,_ .. and then build the narrative around intiial nonprofit system per art/"stimulating" motives docuemnted at (https://web.archive.org/web/20100730143358/http://mtgox.com/trade/history) v. sale and death of single efficient provider after introducing profit (by aquirer) at https://web.archive.org/web/20111016114851/https://mtgox.com/fee-schedule
[^ta-alt]: By and large, there is generally (in the modern context) only one fucking reasons that an issuer would request a cert pull, whcih was dissalowed at https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/self-regulatory-organization-rulemaking/sr-dtc-2003-02 {although I agree with [these comments](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1136343213091856486/1258778464924729427)}
