# Narrative ideas

- We don't trust Wall St because Wall St doesn't trust us.[^trust]
- Requisite decentralized clearing/settlemnet/exhange [exchange since obv no need for delegation in digital assets][^jed_1]
- Direct clearing for brokers to use with simle settlement regime comeptition(use as segue to anticompetative practices and materially dive into the need for competition from TAs)
- Narrative around TA future as  seomthign more than a cert pusher, express neeed fro better systems per EQ hack and horrendus best pract
- Using regulatory status to preclude competition[^ta-alt]
- FAST requirements are based on a flawed system for transferring ownershuip of book entry securities
- FAST requirements do not protect investors because TAs can get 100%-deductable insurance (coul use adequately here if youi want to give some derffference to commission rulemaking procedures commenting on the policies)

[^trust]: _See, e.g., supra_ note [] at n.X detailing the manipulation of capitalistic supply and demand when firsm ceased believing in the ability of free markets to accurately value multiple public companies with current Commission filings.
[^jed_1]: _See, e.g.,_ .. and then build the narrative around intiial nonprofit system per art/"stimulating" motives docuemnted at (https://web.archive.org/web/20100730143358/http://mtgox.com/trade/history) v. sale and death of single efficient provider after introducing profit (by aquirer) at https://web.archive.org/web/20111016114851/https://mtgox.com/fee-schedule
[^ta-alt]: By and large, there is generally (in the modern context) only one fucking reasons that an issuer would request a cert pull, whcih was dissalowed at https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/self-regulatory-organization-rulemaking/sr-dtc-2003-02 {although I agree with [these comments](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1136343213091856486/1258778464924729427)}

^all of this will need to move into `static` or rebase the repo directory (much harder)
best option is using:
